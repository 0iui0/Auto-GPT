      ''Hello World'' into a file named \"hello_world.txt\" and then use the task_complete
      command to complete the task.\nYour decisions must always be made independently
      without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue
      simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\n1. Use the write_to_file
      command to write ''Hello World'' into a file named \"hello_world.txt\".\n2.
      Use the task_complete command to complete the task.\n3. Do not use any other
      commands.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your
      short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2.
      If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events,
      thinking about similar events will help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4.
      Exclusively use the commands listed below e.g. command_name\n\nCommands:\n1.
      append_to_file: Append to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\":
      \"<text>\"\n2. delete_file: Delete file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n3.
      list_files: List Files in Directory, args: \"directory\": \"<directory>\"\n4.
      read_file: Read file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n5. write_to_file:
      Write to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"\n6.
      delete_agent: Delete GPT Agent, args: \"key\": \"<key>\"\n7. get_hyperlinks:
      Get text summary, args: \"url\": \"<url>\"\n8. get_text_summary: Get text summary,
      args: \"url\": \"<url>\", \"question\": \"<question>\"\n9. list_agents: List
      GPT Agents, args: () -> str\n10. message_agent: Message GPT Agent, args: \"key\":

      \"name\": \"<name>\", \"task\": \"<short_task_desc>\", \"prompt\": \"<prompt>\"\n12.
      task_complete: Task Complete (Shutdown), args: \"reason\": \"<reason>\"\n\nResources:\n1.
      Internet access for searches and information gathering.\n2. Long Term memory
      management.\n3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.\n4. File
      output.\n\nPerformance Evaluation:\n1. Continuously review and analyze your
      actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.\n2. Constructively
      self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.\n3. Reflect on past decisions
      and strategies to refine your approach.\n4. Every command has a cost, so be
      smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.\n5.

      simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\n1. Use the write_to_file
      command to write ''Hello World'' into a file named \"hello_world.txt\".\n2.
      Use the task_complete command to complete the task.\n3. Do not use any other
      commands.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your
      short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2.
      If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events,
      thinking about similar events will help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4.
      Exclusively use the commands listed below e.g. command_name\n\nCommands:\n1.
      append_to_file: Append to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\":
      \"<text>\"\n2. delete_file: Delete file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n3.
      download_file: Download File, args: \"url\": \"<url>\", \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n4.
      list_files: List Files in Directory, args: \"directory\": \"<directory>\"\n5.
      read_file: Read file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n6. write_to_file:
      Write to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"\n7.
      delete_agent: Delete GPT Agent, args: \"key\": \"<key>\"\n8. get_hyperlinks:
      Get text summary, args: \"url\": \"<url>\"\n9. get_text_summary: Get text summary,
      args: \"url\": \"<url>\", \"question\": \"<question>\"\n10. list_agents: List
      GPT Agents, args: (config: autogpt.config.config.Config) -> str\n11. message_agent:
      Message GPT Agent, args: \"key\": \"<key>\", \"message\": \"<message>\"\n12.
      start_agent: Start GPT Agent, args: \"name\": \"<name>\", \"task\": \"<short_task_desc>\",
      \"prompt\": \"<prompt>\"\n13. task_complete: Task Complete (Shutdown), args:
      \"reason\": \"<reason>\"\n\nResources:\n1. Internet access for searches and
      information gathering.\n2. Long Term memory management.\n3. GPT-3.5 powered
      Agents for delegation of simple tasks.\n4. File output.\n\nPerformance Evaluation:\n1.
      Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to
      the best of your abilities.\n2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture
      behavior constantly.\n3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine
      your approach.\n4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim
      to complete tasks in the least number of steps.\n5. Write all code to a file.\n\nYou
      should only respond in JSON format as described below \nResponse Format: \n{\n    \"thoughts\":
