Running Code First Method of Re-Architecting Auto-GPT

SwiftyGPT is a holding name so I can setup optimal import methodology without messing up the original codebase.

Starting by building up minimal setup to have a running agent.
Then add in the functionality of James' code bit by bit always making sure the agent still runs.

Aim is to get to having all example agents running asap with the new architecture so we can start testing and building on top of it.
